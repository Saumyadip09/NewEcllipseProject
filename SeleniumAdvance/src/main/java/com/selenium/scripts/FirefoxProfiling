 In the run section
 firefox.exe -p profilemanager
 
 profile means new instance of the browser...
 each and every instance will be a fresh instance..
 Normally when the firefox is installed there is a default profile created.
 In the default profile we generally add the firepath or firebug.
 
 I can add one more profile in the profile window.
 (If we open it,it will be fresh and no details will be there).
 This profiling is present only in the Firefox.
 
 
 Why it is needed.
 
 (WebDriver driver = new FirefoxDriver();
 driver.navigate().to("https://www.google.com");)//The firefox instance will be a fresh instance created by selenium
 
 The problem with this is (bookmark,proxy settins,firepath,firebug)...these can't be use that.
 
 It is difficult to debug from that window.()
 
 
 
 How to resolve it::::
 
 ProfileIni is the class in Selenium which creates a profile.
 
 ProfileIni profile = new ProfileIni();
 FirefoxProfile myProfile = profile.getProfile("default");
